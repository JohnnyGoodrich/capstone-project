# Macro Tracker
## Scope
For my capstone project I will be creating a fitness app that allows the user to log in their food for the day in order to track their nutrional in-take for the day (calories and macro-nutrients)

## User Story
* As a user I want to be able to sign-up/sign-in so I can have a profile that saves my data
* As a user I want to be able to set daily calorie and nutritient goals for the day
* As a user I want to be able to log my food consumed throughout the day and save my meals
* As a user I want to be able to see my progress toward my calorie and nutrient goals displayed
